Our basic approach to I/O for Fortran is different
from the C approach.  Rather than write general purpose
analogs of read and write, we have written template 
functions for I/O.  These need to be modified for use with 
a particular application.  See functions Cread, Build_derived_type,
and Cprint in cio.f
